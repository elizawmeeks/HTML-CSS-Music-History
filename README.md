# HTML-CSS-Music-History

## Version 3

I basically gave up on the instructions for music history 3 and (belatedly realized that I) kind of made up a melange of music history 3 and 4 (and also kind of didn't). But I think that my function that randomizes which 4 songs it shows is cool so I'm gonna leave it up there for now. Adding music adds it to the object, but I had trouble getting it to format exactly the same way with objects inside of arrays. I didn't output it to the dom because with the randomizing function it wouldn't necessarily dispaly. Basically I decided that I liked the randomizing function better than outputting all the songs for the moment.

I might come back and make things align more with the instructions, but I also learned a lot and had a lot of fun which is, frankly, enough for me.
